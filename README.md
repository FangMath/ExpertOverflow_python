# ExpertOverflow Python Implementation

This is the ipython implementation of ExpertOverflow. It is used for the
initial model development and test. We use the smaller dataset of 
[**Stats Overflow**](http://stats.stackexchange.com/)(~546M) for the first develpment.

A better documentation is needed...
